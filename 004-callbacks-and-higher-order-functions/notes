011 - Callback vs Higher-order Functions
-Higher order function is just a function that can take in another function as one of its parameter
-A callback function is a function that is being passed to a function as a parameter

Slide01
-------
Higher-order functions
Takes in a function or passes out a function

Just a term to describe these functions - any function that does it we call that - but there's nothing different about them inherently

Slide02
-------
So callbaks and higher order functions simplify our code and keep it DRY and they do something even more powerful: they allow us to run asynchronous code


010 - First-Class Objects
-Why JavaScript can pass a function as a parameter?
-> Because js function is an object, a first class object

-The only difference between function and ordinary object in JS is that a function can be invoked

Slide01
How was this possible?
Functions in javascript = first class object

They can co-exist with and can be treated like any other javascript object
1. assigned to variables and properties of other objects
2. passed as arguments into functions
3. returned as values from functions

-A simple clarification

008 - Deconstructing Generalize Function
-A simple line by line of the generalize function

007 - Reviewing Generalizing Function
DRY - don't repeat yourself

Slide01
--------
We could generalize our function so that we pass in our specific instruction only when we run the copyArrayAndManipulate function!

function copyArrayAndManipulate(array, instructions) {
  let output = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    output.push(instructions(array[i]));
  }
  return output;
}

function multiplyBy2(input) {
  return input * 2;
}

let result = copyArrayAndManipulate([1,2,3], multiplyBy2);

-A simple line by line explanation of the code

005 - Q&A- Const and Let
-Use 'const' for everything, unless we want to change it - use 'let'


004 - Paramaterizing Functions
-We could generalize our function by adding parameter
-Simple explanation line by line
